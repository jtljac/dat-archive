# Description
The File is split into 3 parts:

## The Header
The header contains:
* signature: A signature to identify the filetype 
* version: The version of the file standard
* tableOffset: The offset from the beginning of the file at which The Data Table begins

## The Data:
The data section contains all the files that are in the archive, stored sequentially with no padding.
The boundaries and metadata of each file is stored in The Data Table.

## The Data Table:
The Data Table is a list of Table Entries, each of which represent a file stored in the data section.
Each Table entry contains:
* nameLength: The length of the name of the file
* name[]: The name of the file as utf-8 characters.
* compressionMethod: An enum representing how this file has been compressed, set to NONE (0) for no compression.
* fileFlags: Extra flags that may apply to the file
* crc32: A CRC32 checksum for the file. This will always be the CRC32 of the file as it is stored in the archive.
* originalSize: The original size of the file before compression, this is set regardless of whether the file is compressed or not.
* dataStart: The offset from the beginning of the archive file at which the file begins
* dataEnd: The offset from the beginning of the archive file immediately following the final byte of the file.

The Data Table must be in the same order as the files in the data section.

### Notes
* Due to the name having a variable length, each table entry is not a fixed size and thus cannot
be looked up randomly. Therefore, decoding the data table must occur sequentially.
* Flags are read from right to left, where the rightmost bit is bit 0, encrypted
* In the current version of the spec, the only compression method that is required is ZLIB, this may change in the future.
* In the current version of the spec, the only file flag is ENCRYPTION (bit 0), this may change in the future.
